What *is* a computer?  
* A machine that performs instructions  
* Calculator

What is a CPU?  
* **C**entral **P**rocessing **U**nit  
* Different CPUs have different instructions  

How do our peripherals communicate with the CPU?  
* Each of the devices are capable of execing instructions.
* However, our IS is limited, thus the dedicated processing can be coded and never changed  

The way we have designed computers there are various CPS that process instrs. Some are fixed due to the nature of the device, some are not (e.g IoT)  

*Example*: A thermometer
* Analog conversion to digital number on a display  
* Uses sensor to find the analog amount
* How does this number get to the display?
* Generate the right electricity to display it

Do the programs on the device change?  
We refer to these dedicated coding as **firmware**  

What can we do with a chip? 
* A functional computer that we have is general purpose  

There are a set of instructions associated with the architecture of the CPU  

Many components to the computer
* Memory
* CPU
* PSU
* GPU
* ~~IOU to mom for stealing her credit card to build the computer~~  

How to manage all these things?  
> *This is the essence of this class*  

Without the operating system, there is very little that you can do
